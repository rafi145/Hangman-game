Overview:

Welcome to the Hangman Game! 
This classic word-guessing game has been implemented in C and challenges you to guess the name of an animal. You can choose between two difficulty levels: Easy and Medium. The Easy mode offers a hint to help you out, but you only have three strikes to guess correctly, regardless of the mode you choose. Let's get started and see how many animals you can guess!

How to Play

Choose Difficulty: At the start of the game, you will be prompted to choose a difficulty level.

Easy: You get one hint to assist you in guessing the animal.
Medium: No hints are provided.
Guess the Animal: You will be given a word represented by underscores, where each underscore stands for a letter in the animal's name.

For example, if the animal is "cat", it will be shown as _ _ _.
Input Your Guess: Enter one letter at a time to guess the word.

  If the letter is correct, it will replace the corresponding underscore(s).
  If the letter is incorrect, you will receive a strike.
Strikes: You have a total of three strikes.

  If you guess a letter incorrectly, you will lose a strike.
  If you lose all three strikes, the game is over.
